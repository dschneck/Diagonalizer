# Diagonalizer
Input: a randomly generated n by n matrix

Output:  if cannot be diagonalized, return the eigenvalues and find which eigenvalue cause the problem, i.e. the corresponding eigenspace dimension is less than the multiplicity of the eigenvalue.

if it can be diagonalized, print the matrix P and D, such that AP=PD
